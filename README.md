# KnowingMe

Knowing Me, Knowing you is a party game first demo'd at a friend's 30th birthday getaway weekend, where many of the guests hadn't met before.  

The game is played as follows: Type in your name (saved in LocalStorage), then click the timer to start the timer (defaults to 45 seconds).  Read the question allowed to the group, and if you *Truthfully* answer it, click the check mark -- if you want to pass, click the X. Your total points will be tallied at the end of your turn. The goal is to blaze through the questions/answers as fast as humanly possible, since more authentic icebreaker answers come out that way (and make for more laughs!). 

When all players have played "Round 1", we move to Round 2, which is a group round -- one person serves as the reader, and this time, from LocalStorage memory, the game will randomly choose a previous question along with the person who was asked that question -- the group then has to yell out how that person answered the question.  In this round, you can either give points to whoever shouted it first, or just have round 2 not count points (my preferred method). 

Have fun!
